 <p>If you've decided to learn (or relearn!) Biblical Hebrew, this website is for you.</p>
  
  <p>These pages  cover only pronunciation, 
  that is, sounding out words without necessarily understanding their meanings. 
  Pronunciation is really important, pbh in the Tanakh intended to be spoken  (actually, sung/chanted)
 
Most of the time I have not provided 
  translations of words used as examples; these pages are not intended to teach vocabulary. 
  And trying to learn vocabulary out of context is unproductive. List of words with translations in alefbet+

 </p>
  <p>this page not about teaching understanding bh or voacbulary but all examples are from words whose roots occur at 
 least 500 times in the Tanakh </p>
  <p>
Audio is a feature of this site. You can click on every Hebrew word to hear it pronounced.
 </p>
 <p>The website pages are:</p>
 
 
 <h3 style="margin-left:10px;"><a href="alefbet.html" >Alefbet<a></h3>
 <div  class="indented-text">
 <p>The alefbet (consonants) and vowels; how to pronounce words by breaking them into syllables, and which syllable is stressed (emphasised).</p>
 <p>Also information about cantillation marks. Worthwhile making the extra effort to learn about these, as they 
 are invaluable in assisting with pronunciation but also later on in understanding punctuation to help decipher the Hebrew text.</p>
</div>
 
 <h3 style="margin-left:10px;"><a href="alefbet-exercises.html" >Alefbet exercises</a></h3> 
 <div class="indented-text" >
<p>This page has lots of exercises to help you learn how to pronounce  words in Biblical Hebrew.
All the exercises have audio for every word so that you can immediately check your pronunciation.
more than 300 frequently occurring words, selection, different each time and different order
</p>
<p>practise consonant sounds, vowel sounds, select one or more consonants and vowels and practise the consonant plus vowel sound they make, 
</p>
<p>practise dividing words into syllables, using the cantillation marks to find the stressed syllable
</p>

<p>names of people and places in the Tanakh </p>
</div>
	
	
 <h3 style="margin-left:10px;"><a href="alefbetplus.html" >Alefbet &#xFF0B;</a></h3>
 <div class="indented-text" >
<p>This page contains extra information and background about Biblical Hebrew pronunciation.
You may find some of this useful.
 
 These are definitely not necessary when if you are a beginner. Strongly suggest you ignore these at first!
</p>
<p>Things that puzzled me, especially pronunciation of kametz (still puzzles me) possibly somewhat obsessed with this..
</p>
</div>


<h3 style="margin-left:10px;"><a href="resources.html">Resources</a></h3> 
 <div class="indented-text" >

<p>The text of the blessing before Torah study, and some links to free internet resources related to pronunciation. </p>

  <h3>challenging + hints</h3>
 <p>If you are just beginning your Biblical Hebrew journey..
Learning Hebrew, especially if you're new to the Hebrew letters and vowels, can be challenging. 
Remember, consistency is key. It's better to practice a little each day, even just 10 minutes, rather than infrequent, long bursts.
If you're a complete beginner, you might start by selecting one or two letters that interest you and learn them first. 
Keep at it, do a little each day, frequent small amoutns of practise is better than long bursts every now and then. 
 Set aside some time each day - as little as 10 minutes.
 </p>
<p>If you are a complete beginner you may like to start by choosing one or two letters which appeal to you and learning those first.
My favourites are lamech and shin - for a long time these were the only 2 letters I could recognize in the parayerbook.
In alefbet exercises there is an exercise where you can choose one or more consonants and vowels and practise the sounds
</p> 
 <p>If you have never learnt the hebrew letters and vowels be aware that it is challenging.
  </p>
   <p>not a structured course</p>
  <p>Some resources here, but will probably need more. see Resources for suggestions. Difficult learning when don't speak the langauge.
   </p> 
 <p>suggestions - practise reading words you already know - prayerbook, songs </p>
<p>maybe find a study buddy (a "chaver" in the Jewish tradition)</p>

   <h3>why this website?</h3>
    <p>When as an adult I began to learn Biblical Hebrew, [recently]I couldn't find any materials which were exactly 
	what I needed. </p>
	<p>wanted to be able to read and understand texts in the Tanakh but happy to use a translation to help with this.
	</p>
	<p>so started creating a website which has what I woudl have liked - learning to recognize the 100 or so most frequently occurring 
	roots (cos these make up 70%?? of the text, and just enough grammar to be able to decipher the text after having read
	a translation </p>
	<p>initially was going to assume that users already knew the alefbet, but remembered how long it took me to learn - also
	for this couldn't find resources with audio feedbakc and lots of exercises  - had several attempts before finally
	learning in a Yiddish class - thank you Esther Singer! </p>
	<p>So thought I would just have a small page, then grew, needed some exercises, added stuff about pronunciation that's
	often rather buried in the middle of grammar books and it just grew...
	
	</p>
 This website is my project to create the resource that I would have liked when starting on my Biblical Hebrew journey.
 [hebrew lashon kodesh important for deepening relationship with judaism, living a jewish life, connecting with the incredibly rich 
 jewish heritage) wanted to provide a resource for people like me who are coming to Biblical Hebrew as adults, perhaps having missed out on a jewish education 
 as chiodren
 </p>
<p>These current pages are the first part of the project and  cover only pronunciation, 

Audio is a feature of this site [because this is what i needed most and couldn't find].</p>

  <p>Have included the things which I found puzzling as a learner.
 </p>
 <p>Second part of the project, learning to read with understanding, will follow (eventually!)</p>
 
 
  <p>As a person who missed out on a Jewish education as a child, I found learning the hebrew alefbet challenging. </p>

<p> extra bits</p>

<p>Took me a long time and several attempts to learn the alefbet (finally in a Yiddish class, thank you 
 Esther Singer!)
 Main issue with learning one one's own (or even if learning in a class, practising) not having immediate 
 feedback when pronouncing to know whether correct.
 So I have provided exercises with audio, every Hebrew word is clickable to hear the pronunciation. 
 I have tried to provide the resouce that I would have liked to have access to when I was attempting 
 to learn the alefbet.
