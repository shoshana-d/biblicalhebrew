 <div class="hidden">
   <h3> Aim of the lessons</h3>

aim of the lessons - using the translation, figure out which word is which in the Hebrew, ie to understand the Hebrew after reading the translation
Method: learn most frequently occurring words, 
aiming to read Tanakh - 
Biblical Hebrew basic grammar (how bh works) 50 most frequently occurring words account for >50% of Tanakh-  
if you learn some of the extra vocab words will know more than 50 + some more frequently occurring "little" words
aim to recognize words you know -this is not always obvious as they may be disguised with prefixes and suffixes and changes of vowel 
<p>10 mos frequently occurring nouns, 5 most frequently occurring verbs, and the most frequently occurring "little" words - prepositions and others.
Plus extra vocab the next 25 most frequently occurring nouns and the next 15? most frequently occurring verbs and some more numbers and adjectives.
By learning these "little" words should be abel to figure out which words are nouns and which verbs by process of elimination.
</p>
<p>because the most frequent words occur very frequently means that you will quite soon have "friends" in the text, it will not seem so daunting
</p>
<p>also some less frequently occurring "little" (words (words which are not nouns or verbs) so that you can more easily pick out unknown nouns and verbs </p>
  <p>advantages of this approach. more enjoyable, more likely to engage with the text 
  when you don't have to keep looking up words in a dictionary (very souldestroying). 
  more likely to become familiar with the text and hence eventually be able to recognize passages 
  even though don't know all the words (this is the traditional method of learning - large amounts of text learned by heart)
  </p>
  <p>Traditional methods seem to have as their aim to be able to translate a random bit of the text without knwoing its reference - while this would
be a cool party trick  it's not really something that you need to be able to do (unless you want to become aHbrew scholar?)  </p>
 <p>different varieties of Hebrew, even in tanakh (but note that in prayerbook hebrew that is not direct quotes from Tanakh not necessarily exactly the same hebrew and some aramaic)</p>

  <h3  > Getting the most out of the lessons</h3>

 <p>Should do all the exercises. Exercises give the translation and ask you to find specific words from the
translation in the Hebrew. To get the most out of the material you should listen to all the Hebrew until you
can read each passage aloud at approximately the same speed as the recording, and you can distinguish the 
Hebrew word(s) in the recording.
Some sections have "more detail". These are not essential, suggest at first leave them out, come back to them later.
 </p>
 <p>some extra bits "from the liturgy"</p>

 <h2  class="w3-container w3-card  w3-cursive heading-color">First things</h2>

  <p>In these lessons, our starting point will be the English translation of the Tanakh. 
  We will decipher the Biblical text by working out which
 Hebrew words correspond to the English words in the translation.
 Hebrew differs in several important ways from English, in particular:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>A single Hebrew word often corresponds to two or more English words. 
This is because some English words are not separate words in Biblical Hebrew. In Biblical Hebrew, 
  these "words" are added as <b>prefixes</b> (at the beginning of a Hebrew word)  or <b>suffixes</b> (at the end of a word) 
<li>Biblical Hebrew verbs are always a single word and often correspond to 2 or more words in the English translation
<li>The order of words in sentences is often different
<li>Because the Tanakh has a much smaller vocbulary than English, a Biblical Hebrew word often has several different English translations
</ul>
<p>First lesson is about recognizing names - names of God, people and places</p>
<p >The next 3 lessons explain these differences and Lesson 5 discusses different translations - not all translations are equal,
to help you decide which translation(s) will be most helpful for you<p>

 <div class="hidden" style="background-color:yellow">
 
 <p>KJV When the King James Bible was translated and first published in 1611, no Jews lived in England – at least officially.
 So, we know that no Jews served as Tanach translators. Jews were readmitted to England in 1655.
 In 1917, the Jewish Publication Society brought out a Bible English- language translation that became 
 the most popular in the English-speaking world. 
 The JPS literary form consciously was based on the KJV.
 “Translators didn’t live in some vacuum. There are always contexts and issues of identity to deal with. 
 Somebody who studies these translations must know the culture in which the translations worked. 
 You must always ask: What are the translators bringing in from the culture around them?”

A decisive break with the KJV didn’t come until the JPS Tanach, completed in 1962. 
The JPS Tanach is radically different. 
Rather than following a literal (or formal) approach to the text, like KJV and the 1917 translation,
 the new JPS Tanach was a functional equivalent.
 A formal translation is one in which the English follows the form of the Hebrew. 
 The form is intrinsic to its meaning. 
 A functional equivalent consciously shapes the text so that it sounds like a piece of modern literature. 
 So, there’s a lot of subordination rather than coordination.
 Metaphors, for example, are put into terms that we would understand.
 A translator might ask: What did this expression mean in biblical times? 
 How would we express this today?
 Consequently the text winds up sounding more modern because it is brought close to the reader. 
 It’s not literally what the Hebrew says.

Greenspoon says it’s hard to imagine somebody who is not a fan of the KJV in some ways.

“One should ask: What is the purpose of the translation? 
Is it something designed to read out loud in a service? 
Or silently in a private reading? 
You also want to know how your translation handles the traditional Jewish interpretation of the passage.

 <h3>Examples of different translations</h3>

 JPSshe is a tree of life to those who grasp her
